        The Call To India
    </h3>
    <p>
        <img src="images/india.jpg" class="img_right" />
        Loreto in India owes its origin to a visit by Dr Bakhaus to Loreto Abbey, Rathfarnham,
        Ireland, in 1840 to request Mother Teresa Ball to send sisters to set up a school
        for Catholic children in Calcutta. In response to this, Mother Teresa Ball sent
        7 Loreto Sisters and 5 Postulants, all in their twenties, under the leadership of
        Delphine Hart to India, announcing that they would probably never see their homeland
        again. These pioneers were Mother Delphine Hart, Mother Teresa Mons, Mother Martina
        McCann, Sisters Alexia Egan, Benigna Egan, Veronica Fox, Gabriel Doyle, Miss Isabella
        Hart (M.Delphine’s sister), a Miss McDonough who received the habit as Sister Xaveria
        on her deathbed at the end of this first year and two other postulants, Miss Shanley
        and Miss Fitzpatrick. They sailed on a ship named The Scotia. This intrepid band
        left Dublin on September 1, 1841 from Ireland and landed at Babughat, Kolkata on
        December 29, 1841. They were the first congregation to come to North India.
        <br><br>
        There was a formal welcome and religious ceremony at the Cathedral on Portuguese
        Church Street. A great civic reception was held the next day, where they were welcomed
        by the Ladies of the Nun Committee, a large gathering of the people of Calcutta
        and Bishop Carew, and they were installed at the house in Middleton Row.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      
        Earlier occupants of the building included Henry Vansittart, Governor of Bengal
        (1760-64) Sir Elijah Impey, First Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at Calcutta
        (1774-82) and from 1824, the Second Anglican Bishop of Calcutta, Bishop Heber. On
        January 10, 1842, Loreto House School was opened in this building. Meanwhile, the
        construction of St. Thomas’ Church, on the same premises had begun from November
        11, 1841. The Catholic Archbishop of Calcutta, Mgr. Carew, also constructed a residence
        for himself next to the church and at the doorstep of Loreto House. This building
        was then known as St. Thomas’ House. The only original buildings on the premises
        now are St. Thomas’ Church and a part of the building where the college was first
        established. The Provincial of the Loreto institute in India now resides within
        the walls that first housed Loreto College.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On 10th January 1842 the Sisters began the school at Loreto House with 60 pupils
        as well as taking classes in the orphanage at the Murgihatta Cathedral in keeping
        with Mary Ward’s dictum to "love the Poor".<br><br>
        In 1843 Loreto Day School Bowbazar, was founded.
        <br><br>
        An orphanage was opened in Serampore and another boarding school was founded in
        Chandannagar.<br><br>
        In 1847, orphans and boarders from Murgihatta, Serampore and Chandannagar were shifted
        to the beautiful grounds of Loreto Convent, Entally.<br><br>
        In 1857,Loreto Day School, Sealdah was formally inaugurated.<br><br>
        In 1879, Loreto Day School Dharamtalla, founded earlier by laymen, was handed over
        to the Loreto Sisters.<br><br>
        In the early years, Loreto nuns travelled to Dacca, Chittagong, Vellore, Ootacamund,
        Saugor, Hazaribagh and Purnea, establishing institutions, many of which were left
        for others to nurture.
        <br><br>
        Elsewhere, Loreto developed strong and lasting foundations: Loreto Convent, Darjeeling
        [1847], Loreto Convent, Lucknow [1872], Loreto Convent, Asansol [1877], Tara Hall,
        Simla [1899], St Agnes’ Loreto Day School, Lucknow, [1904]<br><br>
        and Loreto Convent, Shillong [1909].
    </p>
     
    <p>
        <img src="images/college.jpg" alt="Loreto College" class="img_right" />
        In the early years of the twentieth century, Loreto ventured into higher education
        for women. In 1912, Loreto College, Calcutta was founded.<br><br>
        Affiliation to the university was granted, first in 1912-1913, for Intermediate
        Arts and later for BA (Bachelor of Arts), ISC (Intermediate Science) and BT (Teacher
        Training).<br><br>
        <br><br>
        The Secondary School Teachers’ Training College was opened in February 1913. The
        courses first offered were for the Licentiate of Teaching and Bachelor of Teaching.</p>
        
        
      <p>   
            Today it offers a Two year post graduate B. Ed. (Bachelor of Education) degree.
       It is affiliated to Calcutta University and in 1998 it was recognized by the National
        Council for Teacher Education, a body set up under the NCTE Act 1993.
        <br><br>
        In 1926 St Teresa’s Girls’ Higher Secondary School was opened for Nepali girls.<br><br>
        In 1942: Pushpa Vidyalaya, the first Loreto Hindi medium school, was started for
        poor children in the compound of St Agnes’ Loreto Day School, Lucknow.<br><br>
        1943: Loreto Convent, Doranda, Ranchi was established. In 1965, Loreto found a home
        in Delhi cantonment<br><br>
        1950s: Vocational Training center, Loreto House was started.<br><br>
        The Commercial College was first begun in Loreto Dharamtala and shifted to Loreto
        House in the 1950s.
        <br><br>
        1954 : Loreto Day School, Elliot Road, Calcutta<br><br>
        1955: The TTC (Trained Teachers’ Certificate), the Primary School Teachers’ Training
        Department of Loreto House was started to provide a course which is certified by
        the West Bengal School Education Department. It’s also recognized by the National
        Council for Teachers’ Education (NCTE).
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        1961: The Government offered the Loreto Sisters a large house, Southfield, on the
        slopes of Observatory Hill to begin a women’s college as there was no college for
        women in the whole Darjeeling District at that time.
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        By the 1970s, new directions were evident in Loreto Education. In 1971, Loreto St
        Vincent’s school was founded in Thakurpukur as a Bengali medium primary school for
        the poor children of the area. In 1979, Jeevan Rekha, Loreto Delhi, established
        a coaching programme for village children.
    </p>
     <img src="images/loretohouseold.jpg" alt="Old Provincialate Building"  class="img_right" />
    <p>
        In 1985, the Rainbow school was established in Loreto Sealdah. Other innovative
        projects devised at Loreto Sealdah include a village programme wherein every week
        some children visit and teach in village schools, the Shikhalaya project initiated
        with government assistance to get every child in Kolkata into school, and the "barefoot
        Teacher Training" to impart basic training to teachers of village schools.<br><br>
        <br><br>
        Several literacy programmes were started, including Ankur Vidyalaya - Literacy Programme,
        Loreto Asansol (1991), Jagriti Literacy and Tailoring center - Lucknow (1994) and
        Asha Kiran, Ranchi- a literacy and tailoring project, while vocational courses were
        offered at Akansha Dam, Loreto Day School, Dharamtala and the Vocational training
